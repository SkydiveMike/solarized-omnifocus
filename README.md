# solarized-omnifocus
Fork of @TEIKI's Solarized Light theme for OmniFocus. Original located here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vrqoo0tirvw75ls/AAAP2oODTCEt3xhiBhImaXGWa?dl=0&amp;lst=

I have this mainly as a private copy to ensure I don't loose it.

# Misc Notes
- The original `Solarized dark TEIKI.ofocus-style` contains font information, but sets `providesFont` to `false`.
- The original `Solarized light TEIKI.ofocus-style` does not contain font information.
